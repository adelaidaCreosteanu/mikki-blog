# Mikki blog - Frontend Project

This project is a microblogging frontend web application named "Mikki Blog". The app allows users to create and view posts, utilizing a mock backend API.

## Tech Stack

- React with Typescript
- Material UI: I chose this because I think their components have a modern look and are easy to use, with great documentation and examples.

## Features Implemented

- User Pages: Users can access a page displaying a list of their posts. They can also visit other user's pages.
- Post Creation: Authenticated users can create posts on their own page.
- Registration and Authentication: Users can register and properly authenticate. This feature was implemented using a React Context.

## Future work

- Implement E2E test with Cypress
- Deploy app with Firebase hosting

  Note: There will be a mixed content error because the backend is not hosted with SSL.
